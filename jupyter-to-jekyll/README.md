# jupyter-to-jekyll

This repository contains scripts created to automate the process of converting Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` files to `.md` markdown format to be used for displaying content on my [personal blog]. After the conversion is complete, the script invokes the `mv` shell command to move files to the appropriate location within my workstation directory. It also parses the converted `.md` file to fix broken image links by performing an elementary find and replace routine.
